# Welcome to Firebase

Firebase is basically just an add on to your app to make it even better and relevent. Being able to incorporate authentication and a realtime database to your app makes it secure and makes it feel up-to-date. There are other things that firebase can do for you but I only dove into the realtime database as well as the authentication. However Firebase is also a platform with its own hosting capability, meaning you can launch an app straight from their platform which is so insane. This is only for web apps though but still amazing.
