# _Writing Java on a Java platform???_  
Java is basically a platform because it is able to run a program using the innate ability of its JVM Java Virtual Machine

The diagram above is a representation of the JVM. The Java Virtual Machine is what makes all the magic happen by having the program compiled so that the computer can read the program. After that the program goes through the processor and executes the program on the computer.

What is a _GUI_? A GUI is a Graphical User Interface

A Graphical User Interface is basically a pop up window that allows the user to access your program. Working on a GUI can be very easy if you go to [Net Beans](https://netbeans.org/). Net Beans is where I went to start working on a GUI and their tutorials were very easy to follow.
