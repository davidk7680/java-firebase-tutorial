### _Syntax:_  
#### Variables:

They are:
byte - 8-bit integer  
short - 16-bit integer  
int - 32-bit integer  
long - 64-bit integer  
float - 32-bit floating point number  
double - 64-bit floating point number  
boolean - true or false  
char - a single character, like 'A' or '$'  
#### Operators:
There are many operators used such as +,-,*,/,%,>,<,= that can be used in boolean expressions.
