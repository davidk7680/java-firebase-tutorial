# Welcome to Java

_Java_ is a very 'simple' language according to people and I agree. Java is definitely much more simplier than what you would have to do without it. Having the ability to compile your code that is compatible to all electronic devices is so much faster than what people had to do before. 

### _Syntax:_  
#### Variables:  
Variables are seperated into types that are in different lengths, because when you compile the code the computer has to read it in bytecode.
They are:
byte - 8-bit integer  
short - 16-bit integer  
int - 32-bit integer  
long - 64-bit integer  
float - 32-bit floating point number  
double - 64-bit floating point number  
boolean - true or false  
char - a single character, like 'A' or '$'  
#### Operators:
There are many operators used such as +,-,*,/,%,>,<,= that can be used in boolean expressions.

### _Writing Java on a Java platform???_  
Java is basically a platform because it is able to run a program using the innate ability of its JVM Java Virtual Machine 



Here are some of the reasources that I used when creating this tutorial.

3 tutorials on the basics of Java programming on `Youtube`

The last one is the beginning of the series so it is much longer than the other 2 but there are also excersices that the coder does. Nonetheless all of them are good tutorials that I believe were useful to me.
